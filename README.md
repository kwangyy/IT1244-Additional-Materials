# IT1244-Additional-Materials
This repo consists of additional materials that I use for my teaching in IT1244. 

## Requirements
I do not expect my students to learn how to create their own environment.
However, in the event you would like to replicate this, here are the requirements:

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikitlearn, Tensorflow

They are also in the requirements.txt document that I have stated.
