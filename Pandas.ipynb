    "We will now move on to Lesson 2! In IT1244, you have used NumPy for most of the data manipulation. It might be a little frustrating to use NumPy for data manipulation sometimes, and a lot of times I personally like to use Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "# WORKFLOW:\n",
    "This is how I taught my teammates on how to do EDA:\n",
    "1. Looking at the data itself - using pd.describe(), pd.count(), pd.value_counts(),\n",
    "2. Filling missing data - using pd.fillna() or pd.dropna()\n",
    "3. Clean data - using pd.apply() or other stuff like that, basically grouping the data into categories\n",
    "4. Visualize data - using matplotlib and seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before we start:\n",
    "- Make sure that Pandas is downloaded on your computer. You might want to use some numpy functions too, so make sure to download numpy. (If you don't know how to download pandas, just pip install pandas on your terminal)\n",
    "- Do know that using pandas might be a little bit tough from the start, but don't be afraid! I'm here to help :)\n",
    "- Do know that I'm cleaning this dataset to use in our other microlessons, so not only do you learn how to manipulate data with Pandas, you also get to see my thought process!\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, let's start!\n",

    "Reading data is really, really simple. For the most part, you just want to make sure that your data is in the same folder as your repo for simple extraction. I have saved all the data I'm going to use in the data folder, so this is what I'm going to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to our computer to read our data so that we can actually manipulate our data. But not only that, we need to understand our data so that we are able to see what to do to our data. For example, there will be numerical columns that are not numerical, and we have to convert the datatype to integer. There might also be some data that can be feature engineered into different features as well!"
