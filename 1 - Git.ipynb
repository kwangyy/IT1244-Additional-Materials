    "# Introduction & Supplementary Materials Lesson 1: Git\n",
    "Hi everyone! This is meant to be supplementary material to the IT1244 course. Obviously there will be some overlap to the main lectures - please watch those - but these materials are more for you to learn how to implement your project (and eventually, real life projects if you're going that route).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are you doing this?\n",
    "I realise that people oftentimes do not know what they're doing in IT1244, and they require additional help. Therefore, this is something that I have decided to invest in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, this is also me trying to show off my Data Science knowledge to employers. It's a win-win. (Not really! But I believe in educating people, so I have decided to create my own materials.) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Are these materials compulsory to do? Will you go through these in class?\n",
    "No - they are not. I will also not go through these in class, but I will be willing to discuss anything from these supplementary materials if needed be! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Do I have to do this in order?\n",
    "For the most part, yes. These assignments presume the previous assignment(s) and the knowledge imparted from these. I assure you however, that I will make it as simple as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can, however, skip the additional models section if needed be especially because: \n",
    "1. You'll need to explain some of these models in your Q&A section - can you? \n",
    "2. The models that are featured can be good enough!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I contribute to this repo?\n",
    "1. Star it! It gives me more visibility and it also allows easy access for you.\n",
    "2. If you'd like to add to the repo, you can send me a message on my [Telegram @foodfoundations](https://t.me/foodfoundations) (might change) or you can always contact me on [Linkedin (will never change)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwang-yang-chia/). We can discuss before you create any content!\n",
    "3. Give feedback to prof about my efforts so that this could be integrated into the IT1244 curriculum itself :p\n",
    "\n",
    "### Any other questions? \n",
    "You know where to find me. All the best in this module!\n",

    "## Lesson 1: Intro to Git\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Git?\n",
    "In a nutshell, Git is a system that helps you coordinate work (relating to code) with your other teammates. It's not real time like any of the Google Drive products, but it's a lot more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do you need Git? \n",
    "You don't! You could use Google Colab for collaborating with your teammates, but there are some problems with Colab:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to work online all the time, which is not ideal\n",
    "- Only one person can edit the code at one time, if not the changes won't reflect :( \n",
    "\n",
    "There are probably more, but I'm not the biggest fan of Colab so I don't know other cons. I don't know of any other solutions that are less tedious than Colab, so Git is your second best option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I heard that Git can be really tedious, is that true?\n",
    "I will admit that it's pretty scary to beginners, but if you're looking to get a job in the Data Science space (or anything software related, really), Git is a very useful tool to use. Also, we will be using GitHub Desktop to make things a lot easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, if you're fine with using other software, it's cool! Not a problem. But if you want to do the exercises I have written here, you definitely need to use git so that you can clone my repo.\n",

    "1. Under \"File\", create a new repository and fill up the details. You can safely ignore Git ignore and License, and you can add in a README if you want to provide more details for your repo. \n",

    "2. Click on collaborators - there might be some authentication or things like that, go through the authentication\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Commit to your own branch.\n",
    "2. Open a pull request to merge into the main branch!\n",
    "3. If it says \"able to merge\", you just need to create the pull request and it'll be ok.\n",

    "Essentially cloning makes a local copy of a repo, while forking creates your own copy of a repo in a remote location. This means that if you want to edit the code for your own perusal (like these notebooks), you probably want to fork instead of cloning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ok, how do I fork?\n",
    "1. On the top right of the repo, there should be a button called \"Fork\". Click that\n",
